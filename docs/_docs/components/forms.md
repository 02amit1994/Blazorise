### Text

To have a basic input text you only need to write this

```html
<TextEdit />
```

But Text by itself is not really usable. To get the value from text field you have two ways. You can bind a Text to member variable use a TextChanged event.


### With placeholder
```html
<TextEdit Placeholder="Name" />
```


### Memo field

```html
<MemoEdit Rows="5" />
```
