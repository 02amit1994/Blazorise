# Text

## Basic text
To have a basic input text you only need to write this

```cshtml
<TextEdit />
```

But Text by itself is not really usable. To get the value from text field you have two ways. You can bind a Text to member variable use a TextChanged event.


### With placeholder
```cshtml
<TextEdit  />
```


## Memo field

```cshtml
<MemoEdit Rows="5" />
```
